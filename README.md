# BytesAux / Aux Bytes Example

### This example shows you how to store uint as bytes in aux and retrieve the value you've stored.

It does use assembly so shoutout to @vectorized for helping me figure out exactly what to do. I'm not trying to be optimised here I just realised that this would be very painful in Solidity.
